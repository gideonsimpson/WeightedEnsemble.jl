Weighted ensemble consists of replicas of a Markov chain, each carrying a weight, that are periodically resampled according to their weights inside of each of a number of bins that partition state space. We derive, from first principles, strategies for optimizing the choices of weighted ensemble parameters, in particular the choice of bins and the number of replicas to maintain in each bin. In a simple numerical example, we compare our new strategies with more traditional ones and with direct Monte Carlo.},

  abstract = {A new method, weighted-ensemble Brownian dynamics, is proposed for the simulation of protein-association reactions and other events whose frequencies of outcomes are constricted by free energy barriers. The method features a weighted ensemble of trajectories in configuration space with energy levels dictating the proper correspondence between "particles" and probability. Instead of waiting a very long time for an unlikely event to occur, the probability packets are split, and small packets of probability are allowed to diffuse almost immediately into regions of configuration space that are less likely to be sampled. The method has been applied to the Northrup and Erickson (1992) model of docking-type diffusionlimited reactions and yields reaction rate constants in agreement with those obtained by direct Brownian simulation, but at a fraction of the CPU time (10-4 to 10-3, depending on the model). Because the method is essentially a variant of standard Brownian dynamics algorithms, it is anticipated that weighted-ensemble Brownian dynamics, in conjunction with biophysical force models, can be applied to a large class of association reactions of interest to the biophysics community.},

Second, we prove a lower bound on the asymptotic variance of weighted ensemble's estimates. Third, we give a constructive proof and numerical examples to show that weighted ensemble can approach this optimal variance bound, in many cases reducing the variance of MCMC estimates by multiple orders of magnitude.},

It is ﬁrst shown using simple arguments that the so-called residual and stratiﬁed methods do yield an improvement over the basic multinomial resampling approach. A simple counter-example showing that this property does not hold true for systematic resampling is given. Finally, some results on the large-sample behavior of the simple bootstrap ﬁlter algorithm are given. In particular, a central limit theorem is established for the case where resampling is performed using the residual approach.},
